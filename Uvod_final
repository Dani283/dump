Gamers today know Naughty Dog like movie-goers know 
Spielberg and Scorsese, and there's a reason for that. 
The minds there continuously make some of the industry's best games, 
ones that push the boundaries of graphical fidelity and storytelling in particular.
In the mid-to-late '90s, the studio was best-known for Crash Bandicoot, but as time has 
gone on -- and since it joined Sony's first party stable -- Naughty Dog's drive to create the best 
mascot platformers, like Jak & Daxter, has evolved into some of the most stunningly realistic and 
engaging story-driven action titles of the current generation in the form of the Uncharted trilogy and The Last of Us.
