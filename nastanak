With their partnership forged and their ability to solve a litany of problems solidified, 
Rubin and Gavin had their own ideas that they wanted to get off the ground, but it was an 
advanced arcade game that they truly coveted: the original arcade iteration of Punch-Out!!. 
Instead of making their own game, they decided to copy Nintendo’s.
And like bold kids that didn’t know any better, they began making a facsimile of the game in 1983.
“We could have made another fighting game like that, but no, we actually copied all the characters exactly,” 
Gavin admitted. “It never occurred to us that you can’t just put out a game that copies characters exactly.” 
But that didn’t stop them. The boys used 1000 ISO film to record all of the game’s moves, and
then began to copy it verbatim using their chops for programming and art. 
They worked on their unofficial PC port of Punch-Out!! for a year. “It was actually pretty good,” Gavin noted proudly.
